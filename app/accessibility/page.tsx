          clinic experience that are accessible to the widest possible audience,
          regardless of ability or technology. We believe that everyone deserves equal
          access to the information and care we provide.
        </p>

          Our website aims to conform to the{" "}
          <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA</strong>{" "}
          standard published by the W3C. These guidelines explain how to make web
          content more accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities, including
          visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, this means we build and review our site for things like:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-2 text-stone-700">
          <li>Sufficient color contrast for text and interface elements.</li>
          <li>Keyboard-only navigation for menus, buttons, and forms.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML, descriptive alt text for images, and visible focus states.</li>
          <li>Labels and instructions on all form fields.</li>
          <li>Predictable, consistent page structure with proper heading levels.</li>
          <li>Support for browser zoom up to 200% without loss of content or function.</li>

        Accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time project. We test our website
        regularly with automated tools and manual review, and we work to fix issues we
        discover. Some legacy content or third-party tools (for example, online booking
        widgets, financing applications, or insurance portals) may not yet fully conform
        to WCAG 2.1 AA. We work with our vendors to push for improvements.
